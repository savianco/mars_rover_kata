Mars Rover Kata

Introduction

We are sending a rover to Mars and we need to program its movements so that we can send it commands from Earth.

Requirements

Download these Mars Rover files to ~/prework/code/labs.
Open your terminal and run the following commands:

cd ~/prework/code/labs
unzip ih-prework-html-css.zip
cd ih-prework-html-css
git init
git add .
git commit -m"Just setting up my Github"
Create a new repo on your Github account, and copy-paste the HTTPS URL (i.e. https://github.com//ih-prework-html-css.git)



Once you are done, run the following commands:

git add remote origin https://github.com/<your-user-name>/ih-prework-html-css.git
git push origin master
Make sure your files have been uploaded into your Github repo before you start.

Open the index.html file and then open your console. You should be able to see the results of any console.log() functions here. 
Make sure you use data structures (basic data types, arrays & objects)
Make sure you use boolean and conditionals
Make sure you use loops to avoid code repetition
Make sure you use functions and organize your code
Submission

Upon completion run the following commands:

git init
git add .
git commit -m"done"
git push origin master
Make sure that your Github repo is updated with your last changes

Send your Github repo link to your TA's through Slack/Email.
Basic Information

The rover will have initial starting point (x,y) coordinates (i.e. 0,0)
The rover will have an initial direction (N,E,S,W) to where it is facing
The rover is on a 10 x 10 grid
Implement commands that go forward and backward (f,b)
Implement commands to turn the rover left or right (l,r). The rover just change the direction it is facing when the user sets this command. It won't move right or left automatically. To make it change its position, the user needs to specify the change of direction and then the actual movement.
Iteration 1

1) Create an object to represent the rover that has position and direction attributes 2) Create a grid using arrays (hint: do a google search for two-dimensional arrays). 3) Write functions for the various commands 4) Try to call some of those functions and display the new position of the rover.

For example, you could start with this:

var Rover = {
  position: [0,0],
  direction: 'N'
}

function goForward(rover) {
  switch(rover.direction) {
    case 'N':
      rover.position[0]++
      break;
    case 'E':
      rover.position[1]++
      break;
    case 'S':
      rover.position[0]--
      break;
    case 'W':
      rover.position[1]--
      break;
  }
}
goForward(myRover);
Iteration 2

We want to be able to send a series of commands to the rover and execute them in sequence.

We will send an array of character commands, which can include:

f for go forward
b for go back
r for turn right*
l for turn left*
*The rover just change its direction when we use this command. It won't move right or left automatically. To make it go right or left, the user needs to specify the change of direction and then the actual movement.

So we should be able to tell the rover, for example, ‘fffrfflfffbb’ and it would execute those movements and provide us with its new position.

Furthermore, we need to make sure that the rover never goes off the grid but rather, wraps from one edge of the grid to another (planets are spheres after all)

Bonus

In your 10 x 10 grid, place some obstacles that the rover cannot cross or land on
Implement obstacle detection. The rover should execute the given commands until it reaches an obstacle, then stop at the last possible position and report the obstacle.
Extra hardcore super bonus

Our rover is lonely! We need to send another one that can roam on the same grid and execute the same commands. Make sure the rovers don’t bump into each other.
